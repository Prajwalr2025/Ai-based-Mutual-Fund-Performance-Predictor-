# 📈 Mutual Fund NAV Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses historical NAV data of mutual funds and macroeconomic factors (like inflation) to train a machine learning model that predicts the **future performance** of mutual funds.  

## 🚀 Project Overview

Mutual funds are influenced by multiple factors, including their past NAV performance and economic conditions.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Collect and preprocess 5 years of historical NAV data.
- Optionally enrich the data with additional features like **inflation rate**.
- Train a time-series model to predict future NAV or percentage growth.
- Visualize results and evaluate model performance.
